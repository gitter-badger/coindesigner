#This file is adapted from CMakeLists.txt written by

# Try to find Coin3D
# Once done this will define
#
# COIN_LIBRARY_FOUND - if Coin3d is found
# COIN_INCLUDE_DIR - where are the includes
# COIN_LIBRARY_RELEASE - the relase version
# COIN_LIBRARY_DEBUG - the debug version
# COIN_LIBRARY - a default library, with priority debug.

# This CMake finder is based in the job done

# http://www.qiew.org

# The modifications was done by

# TODO: 
# the coin version
# to use it with inventor?
